				<p>This is a snapshot from the under 9s game which ended 2-0 to Community United vs Jambon United. 
				Our star player Ralph Johnson is taking the corner in which we scored our first goal.
				We then went into half time with the score 1-0. Straight away into the second half Community United scored.
				That concludes this game.</p>

				<p>This picture is from our senior Women's match where they sadly lost 3-1 to Spaceship F.C. 
				In the first minuite our very own Julie Robberts scored a spectacular goal from kick off. Sadly 15 minuites later Emma Tonkerson from the visitors made it one a pop.
				After Half time Elexa Turner from the Spaceships scored and soon after this the visitors reseved a penalty which they scored at the hands of Eel Teal.
				Sadly that concludes the game.</p>

				<p> This photo shows our u9's team doing a training match against eachother. 
				This training match ended 2-1 to the red team. The game lasted 30 minuites and the boys never stoped trying throughout
				At this time i would like to remind the parents of the children that the membership fee for Community United is due at the end of the month but we are taking payment now.</p>

				<p>This image is taken directly from a u16's match vs Stapler Athletic which ended 4-2 to the away side.					Our players fought bravely and strongly vs the league leaders but it unfortunatly wasn't enough.
				but our star player Evan Trestrial added another two goals to his season tally.</p>

					<p>This photograph is taken of our nursery team training with ex Community alumni Pattrick Staar who went on to play 17 proffesional games for Shinrai F.C.
					Pattrick was teaching the kids some one touch passing drills as he "this is how the gameis evolving".
					The kids were extatic with his apperance and we at Community United would like to thank Pattrick greatly.</p>

				<p>This gem was taken at the Senior male team game in which they played Pigeon Soil C.F. in a must win game.
				The game started with Gabe Newell Communities very own No.9 slotting away an oppertunity. 
				Nothing else really happened until the 89th minuite where Bert Jerkey our captain scored to seal the win.
				This win puts us top of the table with 2 games to go.</p>
